# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Artem and I'm a .NET developer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

### A bit about me
- Big fan of ASP.NET Core and web development
- Not so big, but still a fan of Angular 

### Here are some of my projects:
- <a href="https://github.com/AVLozhechkin/RainBot">**RainBot**</a> - is a Telegram bot that writes to you when rain is seen in the forecasts. This is a set from *Yandex.Cloud functions* written in *C#* and deployed using *Terraform* in *Yandex.Cloud*. It is currently suspended because I found that channel notifications are much better.
- <a href="https://github.com/AVLozhechkin/RainBot.Channel">**RainBot.Channel**</a> - is the next iteration of RainBot. The difference is that it publishes rain notifications in the Telegram channel. The technology stack is the same as in RainBot.
- <a href="https://github.com/AVLozhechkin/CloudMusicPlayer">**CloudMusicPlayer**</a> - is a web application that allows you to listen to music from cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Yandex.Disk. The goal of the project is to improve my full stack ASP.NET Core + Angular + EF Core skills. It is currently in development.
